    <h1>Welcome to Diego's World!</h1>
    <h2>A look inside the mind of a very cute pup</h2>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm Diego! I'm a 13-year-old Dachsund mix (mixed with what, no one knows!). I was born and raised in Southern California but live in Portland, Oregon with my humans Daniela and Morgan, and our roommate Jonny.</p>
    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <p>What do I like to do in my free time (which is all of the time)? Here you go:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Lay in my multiple beds around the house</li>
      <li>Eat my favorite treats!
        <ul>
          <li>Lamb lung</li>
          <li>Cucumbers</li>
          <li>Dinner scraps</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Go on very short walks (I get bored/tired pretty quick)</li>
      <li>Snuggle with my friends</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Thanks for reading about me!</p>
